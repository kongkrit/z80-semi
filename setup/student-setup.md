# BareMetal-C Tool Setup for Windows / macOS

## 0. Conventions, guidelines, and WSL preparation
### Conventions:
This is what you should type or copy & paste into computer (example):
```
type or paste me in
```
and this is what the output from the computer (example):
> ```
> I am the output from the computer
> ```
- **Windows:** contains specific Windows only information.
- **macOS:** contains specific macOS only information.
### Guidelines:
- Whatever folder you choose, make sure there is no `space` in the path name:
- We recommend you to use your `Documents` folder, but here are some **bad examples**. 
  - **Windows:** `C:\Users\NAME\Desktop\whatever\my cat is cute\BareMetal-C-Labs` is **bad** -- use `my-cat-is-cute` instead.
  - **macOS:** `/Users/NAME/Desktop/my cat is cute/BareMetal-C-Labs` is **bad** -- use `my-cat-is-cute` instead.

### WSL prepartion (Windows only):
  Click `Windows start button` and type:
  ```
  turn windows features on or off
  ```
  Run it. Scroll down and check
  ```
  ☑ Windows Subsystem for Linux
  ```
  and click OK.

  Reboot if necessary.

  **Check your current WSL version:**
  - Type `Win+R` and run `cmd` or `powershell` and type:
    ```
    wsl --version
    ```
  - If it says `WSL version: 2.x`, you're ok.
    
    But if it is `1.x`, you must update `WSL` to `WSL2` by:
    ```
    wsl --update
    ```
    Reboot.

    After reboot, do `wsl --version` again to check that you are on `WSL version: 2.x`.

## 1. (Windows & macOS) Install Github Desktop
- Download GitHub desktop from [here](https://desktop.github.com/download/).
- Run it. You don't need to sign up, but you need to provide an email address and name. It's best that you **do not share** email addresses with friends. It can cause problems later.
- From **File** menu, click **Clone a repository from the internet** and select **URL**.
- Clone the following URL:
  ```
  https://github.com/kongkrit/BareMetal-C-Labs
  ```
- Choose **Local path**. For **Windows & macOS**, we recommend your `Documents` folder.
- Github will try to foce you to use `Documents/GitHub` folder, but you can override it!
  - **Windows:** Make Local path `C:\Users\NAME\Documents\BareMetal-C-Labs`
  - **macOS:**
- Click `Clone` and wait for it to finish. Now everything resides in `Documents/BareMetal-C-Labs` folder.

---
## 2. (Windows & macOS) Install Docker Desktop 

- Make sure you have *admin rights* on your computer. That is, you can install new programs for all users, etc.
- Make sure you don't have anything important running. `Docker Desktop` may force you to log out to complete the installation.
- Download `Docker Desktop` from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
  Click *Download Docker Destop* and choose the drop down that matches your computer's CPU:
  - **Windows:** Choose `Windows AMD64`
  - **macOS with M-series chip (starting in late 2020):** `Mac - Apple Silicon`
  - **Older macOS with Intel CPU (before late 2020):** `Mac - Intel Chip`

- Install `Docker Desktop` and `Accept` Docker Subscription Service Agreement. It's free for personal use.
  ### For Windows:
  - Make sure the following box is checked. You want to use `WSL2`:
    ```
    ☑ Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V`
    ```
  - You can skip all the questions

  ### For macOS:
  - Drag and drop `Docker` into your `Applications` folder
  - Run `Docker` and select `Use recommended settings`
  - You can skip all the questions
  - Accept all the permissions
  - Wait for the docker icon (a whale with containers on top) on menu bar to stop dancing.

---
## 3. Prepare to pull the course software container

Windows and macOS instructions are a bit different here.
### For Windows:
- Open **File Explorer** and go to where your project is from GitHub clone above (`Documents/BareMetal-C-Labs`) was recommended.
- Go into `BareMetal-C-Labs` folder
- **Shift + Right-click** inside the `BareMetal-C-Labs` folder window, and select `Open PowerShell window here` or `Open in Terminal`
- You now have a terminal with prompt:
  > ```
  > PS C:\Users\NAME\Documents\BareMetal-C-Labs>
  > ```
### For MacOS
- Use **Finder** and go to where your project is from GitHub clone above. (`Documents/BareMetal-C-Labs`) was recommended.
- Type `Command + space` and type `terminal` and you get a terminal window
- type "`cd `" (`cd` and one space after)
- drag `BareMetal-C-Labs` folder from **Finder** into terminal. terminal now reads: `cd /Users/NAME/Documents/BareMetal-C-Labs` and hit `enter`. Your prompt will be:
  > ```
  > name@computername BareMetal-C-Labs %
  > ```

---
## 4. Pull and launch the tool environment
### For both Windows and macOS:
- Make sure `Docker desktop` is running.
- Copy and paste the command below into command prompt:
```
docker run --name baremetal-c --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/labs kongkrit/baremetal-c
```
(**For macOS:** If `terminal` or `docker` asks you for any permission, give it)

- It will take a while for the first time, but you will end up with a prompt:
  > ```
  > [baremetal-c]:/labs #
  > ```
- If you get the above prompt, your installation is successful.
- From now on, we will call `[baremetal-c]:/labs #` the **tool prompt**.

---
## 5. Test the tools (same for Windows and macOS)

- Type all the commands from `[baremetal-c]:/labs #` prompt (from now on, we will call `[baremetal-c]:/labs #` the **tool-prompt** to indicate that you can only run tools from here):
### Check `sdcc` `z80dasm` and `make` -- all from **tool-prompt**:
Check `sdcc`:
```bash
sdcc --version
```
It should say: `SDCC : mcs51/z80/.../f8 TD- 4.5.0 #15242 (Linux)`

Check `sdasz80`:
```bash
sdasz80 2>&1 | head -n 3
```
It should say: `sdas Assembler V02.00 + NoICE + SDCC mods  (Zilog Z80...)`

Check `z80dasm`:
```bash
z80dasm -V
```
It should say: `z80dasm, Z80 assembly language generating disassembler...`

Check compilation:

We run code from `code` folder inside
```bash
cd code
```
and we use `make` to build our C programs.
```bash
make 000-run.bin
```
and it should say:
> ```
> sdasz80 -l -o default-startup.rel default-startup.s
> cp default-startup.rel 000-startup.rel
> cp default-startup.lst 000-startup.lst
> sdcc -mz80 --std c99 --Werror -c 000-test-mem-nmi.c -o 000-test-mem-nmi.rel
> sdcc -mz80 --no-std-crt0 000-startup.rel 000-test-mem-nmi.rel  -Wl-u -Wl-f,000-memmap.ld -o 000-run.ihx
> 
> Generating Binary and Disassembly 000-run.bin and 000-run.txs...
> 
> sdobjcopy -I ihex -O binary 000-run.ihx 000-run.bin
> z80dasm -a -l -t -z -g0 000-run.bin | awk ' BEGIN { count = 0; } /^[ \t]+nop[ \t]+;[0-9a-fA-F]{4}[ \t]+00.*$/ { buffer[count++] = $0; next; } { if (count > 3) { print buffer[0]; print "    ..."; print buffer[count-1]; } else { for (i=0; i<count; i++) print buffer[i]; } count = 0; print $0; } END { if (count > 3) { print buffer[0]; print "    ..."; print buffer[count-1]; } else { for (i=0; i<count; i++) print buffer[i]; } }' > 000-run.txs
> Warning: Code might not be 8080 compatible!
> 
> Info: 8080 incompatibility warning can be ignored.
> ```
and finally
```
make clean
```
and it should say:
>  ```
>  rm -f *.asm *.bin *.ihx *.lk *.lst *.map *.noi *.rel *.rst *.sym *.txs
>  ```

## 6. How to logout of the tool prompt.
and get back to `tool-prompt`:

Log out of **tool-prompt**. Easy. type `ctrl + d` or type `exit` and you will see:
> ```
> [baremetal-c]:/labs/... #
> exit
> ```
and the prompt changes to `PS C:\...` (Windows), or `name@computername BareMetal-C-Labs %` (macOS)

---
## 7. How to get back to the **tool-prompt**:
- Make sure that `Docker desktop` is running.
- Make sure you're in the correct folder (`BareMetal-C-Labs`).
- Repeat steps in section **4. Launching the tool environment** [above](#4-pull-and-launch-the-tool-environment).
